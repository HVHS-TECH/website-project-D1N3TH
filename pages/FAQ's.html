                                    <strong>Undergraduate study</strong> is your first university qualification, 
                                    typically a Bachelor's degree (e.g., Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science). 
                                    This is the starting point for most school leavers.
                                </p>

                                    <strong>Postgraduate study</strong> is advanced study undertaken after completing 
                                    a Bachelor's degree. This includes qualifications like Graduate Certificates, 
                                    Master's degrees, and PhD doctorates.

                                    Yes, for most domestic students, NCEA Level 3 (with 14 credits in 
                                    3 approved subjects, 8 credits in Literacy, and 10 credits in Numeracy) is the 
                                    standard pathway to gain University Entrance (UE).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, some students may qualify through alternative pathways, such as 
                                    foundation studies, completing the International Baccalaureate (IB), or A-Levels. 
                                    Always check the specific entrance requirements of your preferred university.

                                    Yes, most universities allow you to add, drop, or swap courses within the first 
                                    few weeks of the semester (often called the 'add/drop' period). After this deadline, 
                                    changes become much more complex and may affect your student loan and fees.

                                    Itâ€™s essential to speak with an academic advisor or student support services 
                                    immediately if you are considering changing courses or programs.

                                    No, taking out a loan is optional. However, most domestic 
                                    students use the interest-free Student Loan to cover their compulsory tuition 
                                    fees and course-related costs.

                                <p>
                                    If you or your family can afford to pay the fees upfront, or if you secure 
                                    a significant scholarship, you may choose not to use the loan. Remember, 
                                    a Student Loan also covers a living cost component, which many students rely on.

                                    A Student Loan is money you must pay back (interest-free if you remain in NZ). 
                                    It covers tuition fees and can include a weekly living cost payment.

                                <p>
                                    A Student Allowance is a tax-free grant that you do not have to pay back. 
                                    It is available to eligible students based on your income and your 
                                    parents' income (means-testing) and is designed to help with weekly living expenses.

                                    starts to ensure your funding is processed and available when the semester begins.

                                    For first-year students coming from outside the city, a Hall of Residence is 
                                    generally recommended. It provides catered meals, built-in social networks, 
                                    close proximity to campus, and a simplified cost structure (no separate bills).

                                    Flatting (shared rental housing) offers more independence and is usually 
                                    cheaper overall, but it is better suited for second-year students onwards who have 
                                    established social connections and budgeting skills.

                                    A good rule of thumb for university study is to allocate 2-3 hours of 
                                    self-directed study for every hour of lectures/tutorials. If you have 12 contact 
                                    hours per week, you should plan for an additional 24-36 hours of independent reading, 
                                    research, and assignment work.
